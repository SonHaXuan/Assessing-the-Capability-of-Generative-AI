The supplementary file of the "Race Against the Machines Assessing the Capability of Generative AI in Solving Authentic Assessments" paper

This supplementary file constitutes a comprehensive repository that centralizes a range of critical resources intended for a deep dive into the performance analysis of Generative AI tools - Chat GPT 3.5 Turbo, Chat GPT 4 - Code Interpreter, Microsoft Bing, and Google Bard. The file's structured into distinct folders, each focusing on a specific aspect.

1) The 'Data' comprises the datasets representative of the six levels of Bloom's taxonomy pertinent to the numeric questions.
2) The 'Marking Guide.pdf' encapsulates the detailed marking scheme, designed to standardize the assessment procedure, equipping the marker with clear evaluation metrics.
3) The 'Question.pdf' contains two distinct types of questions, numeric and text.
4) The 'Outcome of the Generative AI Tools.pdf' amasses the responses generated by the four AI platforms. 
5) The 'Raw_grading_data.xlsx' provides scores of answers at each level of all AI tools, marked by 4 different markers. Marker 1 and marker 2 work on the same answers. Marker 3 and marker 4 work on the same answers.
