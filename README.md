# Assessing-the-Capability-of-Generative-AI
The supplementary file of the "Race Against the Machines Assessing the Capability of Generative AI in Solving Authentic Assessments" paper

This supplementary file serves as an integral extension of our research paper, 'Race Against the Machines: Assessing the Capability of Generative AI in Solving Authentic Assessments'. It comprises two distinct questions - a numeric-oriented Question 1 and a text-based Question 2, along with their corresponding rubrics and marking guides. The file further features comparative outputs from four leading generative AI tools, namely, ChatGPT 3.5, ChatGPT 4, Microsoft Bing, and Google Bard, tested against these questions. This comparison provides an in-depth analysis of the capabilities of these AI tools in generating relevant, accurate, and contextually apt responses. As such, this file aids in substantiating our study's findings by providing a clear, comparative snapshot of the performance of these AI tools in handling diverse problem contexts, thereby enhancing our understanding of the practical capabilities of AI in the realm of authentic assessments.
